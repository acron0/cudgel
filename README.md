# cudgel
A ClojureScript API for [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io). Free live reloading from [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel).

```clojure
(require '[cudgel.core :as c])
(require-macros '[cudgel.macros :refer [defgame]])

(def images
  {:einstein-img (c/Image. "img/ra_einstein.png")})

(def sprites
  {:einstein (c/Sprite. (:einstein-img images) 20 20)})

(defn preload [game]
  (c/load game images))
(defn create  [game]
  (c/add game sprites))

(defgame example-game
  "app"
  800 600
  {:preload preload
   :create create})

```

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.

## TODO
 + Figwheel's live reloading needs fixing. It works about 3-4 times then falls over. Possibly something to do with WebGL context. Not sure.
 + API should hide the need for #js reader macro. ClojureScript maps everywhere.
 + 99% of the API is still missing!!
